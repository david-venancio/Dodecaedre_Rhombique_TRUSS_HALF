# Dodecaedre_Rhombique_TRUSS_HALF
>>> 3D-printed building block (that doesn't need supports and is lightweight !). 
  . You stack,or "attach", other blocks by matching 'Lozenge' faces.
  . Perfectly stackable (after applying some rotations and some glue or other technics).
  . Cutted in ****Half*** means that you can use it as the first step of your "building" for flat surfaces.
  . You can turn each block on all axis and imagine what you can do with a lot !... ;P
  . The Scale (so the Size) is changeable (of course, but novices in 3D-print don't know that's so easy so I have to insist on that argument). I suggest to check what size you get at 100%, then play with it. This is very important: at small scales the bars get too thin and weak and could be enlarged. At the opposite, with big scales... you should try some mechanical stress-tests (in all cases btw).
